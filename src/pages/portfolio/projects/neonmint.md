**TapfarTech Website** is a professional portfolio and service showcase built to highlight my technical skills and advertise side hustle services for small businesses. Starting with the NeonMint template, I customized it to create a platform that demonstrates my capabilities while offering website building and IT services as I grow my business.

The site serves as both a resume showcase featuring my military service and technical experience, and a marketing platform for the freelance services I can provide to small businesses on the side.
